# 1. How do you know when to do an if statement?
# if there is two possible paths to be taken or more you use an if statement
# How do you take samples and build something larger out of it?
# break things into smaller parts, smaller parts and put all those small parts together to make a bigger problem
# apply examples that you have done before, apply examples of code and patterns

# 2. Things that make it easier when reading codes, is by using comments.
# Using descriptive variable names is better; ex: 't' vs 'temperature' = temperature is better
# Line spacing is extremely important, grouping things together, like things together
# Using check-ins, keeping track of our changes
# Just Plain documentation, information outside of code is extremely important
# Having a dialogue or someone to ask questions with is huge

# 3. How do you evaluate the accuracy of your code? How do you know it runs right?
# The code gives you an error if it is wrong, it crashes.
# When you look at the error, it can give you a solution or helpful trick as to what's wrong.
# If a character or something doesn't move right, we know it doesn't run right.

# 4. What are the limitations to using numerical methods to make decisions?
# It is easy to mess things up on the algorithms.
# It is influencing society completely.
# There are so many more things more than just stats. We cannot just evaluate people based on their test scores, just
# like we cannot evaluate teachers based on their students' scores and performance.
# There are so many other factors and limitations that are at play/stake.
